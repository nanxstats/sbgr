\description{
This is the first operation performed when you wish to upload a file.
Operation is initialized by providing file name, project id where you
wish the file to be uploaded to (if not specified, defaults to user's stash)
and optionally by providing wanted part size. You may wish to set your
part size to a low value if you experience problems with uploading large
file parts, although default value of 5MB should be good enough for
most users.
