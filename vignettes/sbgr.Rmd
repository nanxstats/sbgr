# Introduction

This guide will get you started to use Seven Bridges API with the _R_
client package `sbgr`, and guide you through the steps needed
to run the
[FastQC Analysis pipeline](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/public/pipelines/534520eed79f0049c0c9443a/),
a simple public pipeline on the Seven Bridges Genomics platform.

The following primary steps will be included:

 * uploading files and setting the metadata;
 * running the [FastQC](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/public/pipelines/534520eed79f0049c0c9443a/) pipeline;
 * downloading the results.

# Preparatory works

## Install the package

Install the latest development version from GitHub:

```{r install_github, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")  # if devtools was not installed
devtools::install_github("road2stat/sbgr")
```

The package runs under Microsoft Windows, OS X, and GNU/Linux. If you meet
any problems when installing the package, please check the
[Bioconductor - Install](http://www.bioconductor.org/install/) page
or [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/road2stat/sbgr/issues)
and report the problem.

To load the package in _R_, simply use

```{r load, eval=FALSE}
library("sbgr")
```

## Get authentication token

The authentication token is used as an _password_ to identify yourself
when aceessing the API. Please remember to keep your authentication token
secure.

To get your authentication token,
[register an account](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/register/)
(if you have already registered, please skip) and
[log in](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/login/) to the dashboard of the
Seven Bridges Platform.

Open the [Account settings - Developer](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/account/?current=developer#developer)
page, click the button in the page to generate the authentication token
(a 32-letter string).

Alternatively, you could use the function `misc_get_auth_token()`
in `sbgr` to get the token and store it as an object in R workspace:

```{r get_token, eval=FALSE}
token = misc_get_auth_token()
```

```
## Enter the generated authentication token:
## 1:
```

This will automatically open the browser and redirect to the token
generation page. You can copy and paste the token into the _R_ console,
press enter, and then the function will save the token as an character
object `token` in the current workspace, which will make it convenient
for you to use it in the next steps. For example:

```{r print_token, eval=FALSE}
print(token)
```

```
## [1] "58aeb140197001306386001f5b34aa78"
```

> The auth token can be continuously used as long as you do not manually regenerate it or disable it on the Seven Bridges platform.

# Create projects

Pipelines need to be executed within projects. We can either use a project
that has already been created, or we can use the API to create a new one.
Let's create one from scratch. We do this using the function `project_new()`.
The function requires a name for the project (we will use the name
`'API tutorial'`) and a billing group, which could be retrived by the
function `billing()`. You can also use the optional parameter `description`
in `project_new()` to set the project description.

```{r create_proj, eval=FALSE}
# Get the first billing group that we have access to
# and use it for the new project
billing_group_id = billing(token)[["items"]][[1]][["id"]]

# Create new project
sbgr_project = project_new(token, name = "sbgr tutorial",
                           description = "sbgr tutorial project",
                           billing_group_id = billing_group_id)

# The list sbgr_project now contains the ID of the new project,
# which we will use in the subsequent calls
sbgr_project_id = sbgr_project[["id"]]
print(sbgr_project_id)
```

```
## [1] "dbf274a0-6dc5-4453-be87-b16965add1aa"
```

> The created project could be seen on the [Seven Bridges platform](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/u/#q).

# Get project details

We will need the ID of a project to edit the file metatdata and
execute pipelines. We can get the details of a project by using
`project_details()`.

```{r project_details, eval=FALSE}
project_details(token, project_id = sbgr_project_id)
```

```
$id
[1] "dbf274a0-6dc5-4453-be87-b16965add1aa"

$name
[1] "sbgr tutorial"

$description
[1] "sbgr tutorial project"

$my_permissions
$my_permissions$write
[1] TRUE

$my_permissions$copy
[1] TRUE

$my_permissions$execute
[1] TRUE

$my_permissions$admin
[1] TRUE
```

The returned list contains the details of the project that you can
access with your auth token. Each project is listed with its ID number,
name, description, and your detailed permissions to access the project.

# Upload files and set file metadata

Download the archive of sample data files [sample1.tgz](https://developer.sbgenomics.com/examples/download/sample1.tgz)
and assume we have extracted the files to the current _R_ working directory.
We will upload the extracted file `sample1.fastq` in this example.

## Upload files using SBG command line uploader

The easiest way to upload files to the Seven Bridges Platform and set
their metadata without using the GUI is via the [SBG command-line uploader](https://developer.sbgenomics.com/tools/uploader/documentation).
Download the latest version of the [SBG command line uploader](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/sbg-uploader/sbg-uploader.tgz).
If you have an older version of the uploader, please be sure to re-download
and use the most recent version. You can also use the function
`misc_get_uploader()` to download the uploader and extract it to
a specified location.

Once we have prepared the uploader and the file, we can use the function
`misc_upload_cli()` to call the CLI uploader for uploading files,
by specifying the parameters in the function:

```{r misc_upload_cli, eval=FALSE}
misc_get_uploader('~/')  # download the SBG CLI uploader to home directory

file_id = misc_upload_cli(token, project_id = sbgr_project_id,
                          file = "sample1.fastq", uploader = '~/sbg-uploader/')
# suppose we have extracted sample1.fastq into current R working directory
```

After successful upload, the function will return the file's ID number:

```{r misc_upload_cli_2, eval=FALSE}
print(file_id)
```

```
## [1] "559c41ebe4b0566fd159709a"
```

> The uploaded file could be seen in the project we just created on the
[Seven Bridges platform](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/u/#q).

<!--

## Using API Calls

Another way to upload files to the Seven Bridges Platform is via the API calls.

Uploading files with the Seven Bridges API is performed as a multi-step
operation. Basically, the required file is uploaded chunk by chunk,
and then assembled as a complete file (in a similar way as the AWS S3 API).
In order to upload a file, you will need to:

  1. Initialize the upload, defining the file name and size of the file.
  2. Get signed URLs for the upload of each of the file parts to Amazon
  Simple Storage Service (S3).
  3. Upload a part using a standard HTTP PUT call to the [Amazon S3pre-signed URL](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html).
  4. If the part has been uploaded successfully, report completion of
  the part upload, otherwise handle the failure (retry, inform user, etc.).
  5. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for each file part.
  6. Once all file parts have been successfully uploaded, report completion
  of file upload.

In this example, we will upload only one file part, since our file is
a small one. For larger files, simply split them into smaller file parts
and repeat the steps shown below.

-->

<!-- TODO: Python tutorial works fine, httr has HTTP 403
     when doing the PUT() step. -->

<!--

```{r upload, eval=FALSE}
# initialize the upload of the file sample1.fastq
init = upload_init(token, project_id = sbgr_project_id,
                   name = "sample1.fastq", size = file.size("sample1.fastq"))

upload_id = init[["upload_id"]]
partinfo = upload_info_part(token, upload_id = upload_id, part_number = 1)
uri = partinfo[["uri"]]
```

After we got the upload URL on Amazon S3, we could use the `httr` package to upload the file to it:

```{r upload_s3, eval=FALSE}
library("httr")
fastqfile = upload_file(normalizePath("~/sample1.fastq"))
upload_s3 = PUT(uri, body = fastqfile)
# upload_s3 = requests.put(uri, data = f)
etag = upload_s3$headers[["ETag"]]
# We make the API call to confirm the successful upload
# to the S3 backing storage
upload_complete_part(token, upload_id, part_number = 1, e_tag = etag)
# We make the call to finalize the upload. This ensures that the
# file becomes available for other API requests.
upload_complete_all(token, upload_id)
```

-->

## Identify uploaded files

To use the files you have uploaded in the previous step, we will first
need to get their ID numbers. After uploading files to the project, we
can obtain the file ID by running the `file_list()` function to list all
the files in the project at anytime.

```{r file_list, eval=FALSE}
file_list(token, project_id = sbgr_project_id)
```

This will return a list about the details of the uploaded files in the project:

```
## $items
## $items[[1]]
## $items[[1]]$id
## [1] "559c41ebe4b0566fd159709a"
##
## $items[[1]]$name
## [1] "sample1.fastq"
##
## $items[[1]]$size
## [1] 16
##
## $items[[1]]$origin
## $items[[1]]$origin$upload_name
## [1] "1436362037099"
##
##
## $items[[1]]$metadata
## $items[[1]]$metadata$file_type
## [1] "fastq"
##
## $items[[1]]$metadata$seq_tech
## [1] "illumina"
##
## $items[[1]]$metadata$sample
## [1] "sample1"
```

## Update file metadata

Once the file is uploaded, we can use the function `file_meta_update()`
to set or update the file metadata. After we got the file ID number,
we can easily set the file metadata by specifying certain parameters
in `file_meta_update()`. For example:

```{r update_meta, eval=FALSE}
file_meta_update(token, project_id = sbgr_project_id,
                 file_id    = file_id,
                 file_type  = "fastq", seq_tech = "Illumina",
                 qual_scale = "illumina18",
                 sample     = "example_human_Illumina",
                 library    = "Test", paired_end = "1")
```

```
## $id
## [1] "559c41ebe4b0566fd159709a"
##
## $name
## [1] "sample1.fastq"
##
## $size
## [1] 16
##
## $origin
## $origin$upload_name
## [1] "1436361569553"
##
##
## $metadata
## $metadata$file_type
## [1] "fastq"
##
## $metadata$qual_scale
## [1] "illumina18"
##
## $metadata$seq_tech
## [1] "Illumina"
##
## $metadata$sample
## [1] "example_human_Illumina"
##
## $metadata$library
## [1] "Test"
##
## $metadata$paired_end
## [1] "1"
```

The new metadata of the file will be shown after being succesfully updated.

The `sbgr` package also has a helper function
`misc_make_metadata()` to generate metadata files. For more
information about metadata, please refer to the
[file metadata documentation](https://developer.sbgenomics.com/platform/metadata).

# List public pipelines and add pipelines to project

We want to run the [FastQC pipeline](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/public/pipelines/534520eed79f0049c0c9443a/)
in our project, so we will need its ID number to identify it. Since the FastQC pipeline is available in the
[Seven Bridges public pipelines repository](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/public/pipelines),
we will now list all of these pipelines along with their IDs to find
the ID that we need. We can list all public pipelines via `pipeline_list_pub()`:

```{r pipeline_list_pub, eval=FALSE}
pipeline_list = pipeline_list_pub(token)
# convert public pipeline list to a matrix
pipeline_mat = matrix(unlist(pipeline_list$items), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
print(pipeline_mat)
```

The pipeline we want is "FastQC Analysis", so we will copy it to our project
using the function `pipeline_add()`:

```{r pipeline_add, eval=FALSE}
# Get the FastQC pipeline ID number in pipeline_mat
pipeline_add(token, project_id_to = sbgr_project_id,
             pipeline_id =
               pipeline_mat[which(pipeline_mat[, 2] == "FastQC Analysis"), 1])
```

This call returns the details of the copied pipeline.

```

##
## $name
## [1] "FastQC Analysis"

## $description
## [1] "The FastQC tool, developed by the Babraham Institute, analyzes sequence data from FASTQ, BAM, or SAM files. It produces a set of metrics and charts that help identify technical problems with the data.

##
## $revision
## [1] "0"
```

The added pipeline could also be seen in the project we created on the
[Seven Bridges platform](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/u/).

> Note that the pipeline now has a **new** ID number. This identifies the
pipeline within your project. The ID of a pipeline when listed in the
public repository is **different** from its ID when listed inside your project.

# Get pipeline details and find input nodes

Assume we have cloned the [FastQC pipeline](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/public/pipelines/534520eed79f0049c0c9443a/)
into our project via the above code or via the SBG platform. Now we need
the **new** ID number of the FastQC pipeline in our project, so we can
execute it via the API. To get the details of all available pipelines
in your project, use `pipeline_list_project()`:

```{r pipeline_list_project, eval=FALSE}
project_pipeline = pipeline_list_project(token, project_id = sbgr_project_id)
print(project_pipeline)
```

This will return a list of the pipelines in the specified project:

```
## $items
## $items[[1]]
## $items[[1]]$id
## [1] "559c3848896a5d236e19d4a2"
##
## $items[[1]]$name
## [1] "FastQC Analysis"
```

Now we can extract the ID number of the pipeline:

```{r pipeline_list_project_2, eval=FALSE}
pipeline_id = project_pipeline[["items"]][[1]][["id"]]
```

To input the file we uploaded to a pipeline, we have to get some more
of the pipeline's details. In particular, we will need to get the ID number
of its _input nodes_. We can list the full details of our chosen pipeline
inside the project using the function `pipeline_details()`:

```{r pipeline_details, eval=FALSE}
fastqc_details = pipeline_details(token, project_id = sbgr_project_id,
                 pipeline_id = pipeline_id)
print(fastqc_details)
```

The returned list contains the information of the pipeline. We can see that
our chosen pipeline contains a single input node with ID `177252`:

```
## $id
## [1] "559c3848896a5d236e19d4a2"
##
## $name
## [1] "FastQC Analysis"

```

This call returns a list of information about the FastQC pipeline.
In particular, it gives the following information:

  * `id`: The ID number of the pipeline, used by the API to uniquely
  refer to it
  * `revision`: The revision of the pipeline
  * `name`: The human-readable name of the pipeline
  * `description`: A short description of what the pipeline's function
  * `inputs`: An array listing the pipeline's input nodes, i.e. those
  pipeline apps which require files as input
  * `nodes`: An array of intermediary nodes, representing the pipeline
  apps which transform the data. These may have editable parameters
  that should be set before running the pipeline, although in this
  particular pipeline example no parameters are editable.
  * `output`: An array of output nodes, representing apps that produce files,
  reports, visualizations, etc.

We will need to pay special attention to the sub-string that is a list of
key-value pairs marked `inputs` for pipeline input nodes. Under each `input`
node is a list of suggested files. These are the publicly available files
that Seven Bridges Genomics recommends providing as input. Typically these
are reference files, such as _reference genomes_, _SNP databases_,
_known indels_, etc.

By inspecting the `inputs` part of the response to the call we just made,
we can see the names and ID numbers of the suggested files for each input app.
Notice that there is an app named `FASTQ`, which takes fastq files as input.
This will be where we input the file `sample1.fastq` we want to analyze.
We could extract and store the input id as `input_id`:

```{r input_id, eval=FALSE}
input_id = fastqc_details$inputs[[1]]$id
```

# Run the pipeline

Now we have collected all the necessary data to run the pipeline:

Data        | R Object          | ID Number
------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------
Project ID  | `sbgr_project_id` | `dbf274a0-6dc5-4453-be87-b16965add1aa`
Pipeline ID | `pipeline_id`     | `559c3848896a5d236e19d4a2`
Input ID    | `input_id`        | `177252`
File ID     | `file_id`         | `559c41ebe4b0566fd159709a`

We can then run the pipeline task using `task_run()` to execute a task:

```{r task_run, eval=FALSE}
# put input_id and file_id into list
inputs = list(list(file_id))
names(inputs) = input_id

# put the task info into a list
task = list(
  "name" = "FastQC with sbgr",
  "description" = "FastQC task with sbgr",
  "pipeline_id" = pipeline_id,
  "inputs" = inputs
  )

# add and run the task
fastqc_task = task_run(token, project_id = sbgr_project_id, task_details = task)
print(fastqc_task)
```

If the request is well-constructed and contains valid IDs, it will return
details of the newly-created task as a response:

```
## $id
## [1] "2bfb18cc-f969-43a1-af75-8d63c1e0f54a"
##
## $name

# Monitor the task and download the results

Tasks typically take a long time to finish. We can periodically (say,
every 30 seconds) check the status of a task by using the function
`task_details()`:

```{r task_details, eval=FALSE}
while (TRUE) {
  task_running = task_details(token, project_id = sbgr_project_id,
                              task_id = fastqc_task$id)
  cat("Running FastQC task...\n")
  if (task_running[["status"]][["status"]] != "active") break
  Sys.sleep(30)
}

print(task_running)
```

Usually after running for several minutes, the task should be finished,
and you will receive emails when the task is finished. Alternatively,
you could also monitor the task status in your dashboard on the SBG website.
The output would contain the task information:

```

```

Once a task has finished, you can locate and download its output files.
You will need an external program like `wget` to perform the download.
We use the function `file_download_url()` to return the download URLs of
the output file (for example, the first output file):

```{r download, eval=FALSE}
report_url = file_download_url(token, project_id = sbgr_project_id,
                               file_id = task_running[["outputs"]][[1]][[1]])
download.file(url = report_url[["url"]], destfile = "fastqc_report.zip",
              method = "wget")  # download the output archive using wget
untar("fastqc_report.zip")  # extract the zipped files
browseURL("sample1_fastqc/fastqc_report.html")  # open html report in browser
```
